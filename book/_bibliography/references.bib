  abstract = "The Critical Assessment of Functional Annotation (CAFA) is an
              ongoing, global, community-driven effort to evaluate and improve
              the computational annotation of protein function. Here we report
              on the results of the third CAFA challenge, CAFA3, that featured
              an expanded analysis over the previous CAFA rounds, both in terms
              of volume of data analyzed and the types of analysis performed.
              In a novel and major new development, computational predictions
              and assessment goals drove some of the experimental assays,
              resulting in new functional annotations for more than 1000 genes.
              Specifically, we performed experimental whole-genome mutation
              screening in Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aureginosa genomes,
              which provided us with genome-wide experimental data for genes
              associated with biofilm formation and motility ( P. aureginosa
              only). We further performed targeted assays on selected genes in
              Drosophila melanogaster , which we suspected of being involved in
              long-term memory. We conclude that, while predictions of the
              molecular function and biological process annotations have
              slightly improved over time, those of the cellular component have
              not. Term-centric prediction of experimental annotations remains
              equally challenging; although the performance of the top methods
              is significantly better than expectations set by baseline methods
              in C. albicans and D. melanogaster , it leaves considerable room
              and need for improvement. We finally report that the CAFA
              community now involves a broad range of participants with
              expertise in bioinformatics, biological experimentation,
              biocuration, and bioontologies, working together to improve
              functional annotation, computational function prediction, and our
              ability to manage big data in the era of large experimental
              screens.",

@ARTICLE{Zirkle1935-sb,
  title     = "The Inheritance of Acquired Characters and the Provisional
               Hypothesis of Pangenesis",
  author    = "Zirkle, Conway",
  abstract  = "1. Lamarck was neither the first nor the most distinguished
               biologist to believe in the inheritance of acquired characters.
               He merely endorsed a belief which had been generally accepted
               for at least 2,200 years before his time and used it to explain
               how evolution could have taken place. The inheritance of
               acquired characters had been accepted previously by Hippocrates,
               Aristotle, Galen (?), Roger Bacon, Jerome Cardan, Levinus
               Lemnius, John Ray, Michael Adanson, Jo. Fried. Blumenbach and
               Erasmus Darwin among others. 2. If we wish to trace the history
               of evolution, we should search for naturalists who lived before
               Lamarck and who did not believe in the inheritance of acquired
               characters. Brock listed but two, (1) the unknown editor of
               Aristotle's ``Historia Animalium,'' and (2) the philosopher,
               Immanuel Kant. 3. The dogma of the immutability of species met
               with general acceptance only late in the eighteenth and early in
               the nineteenth century. Botanists from the time of Theophrastos
               to the time of Linnaeus believed in ``degeneration.''
               ``Degeneration'' did not then have its modern meaning, but was
               synonymous with De Vriesian mutation. Belief in degeneration was
               not incompatible with belief in special creation, as its effects
               were supposed to be neither orderly nor cumulative. 4. In order
               to understand what Charles Darwin meant by his provisional
               hypothesis of pangenesis, it is necessary that we do not give to
               the terms he used the meanings which they acquired during the
               twentieth century. Darwin's conception of the germ-plasm was not
               the one currently accepted. He considered the theory that the
               foetus was produced from an egg fertilized by a single
               spermatozoan but rejected it. He believed that the whole semen
               was a fertilizing substance and that the foetus resembled the
               father in proportion to the amount of semen ejaculated in
               coition. Furthermore, he believed in telegony and in the
               specific influence of semen upon the mother's body. 5. The
               hypothesis of pangenesis is as old as the belief in the
               inheritance of acquired characters. It was endorsed by
               Hippocrates, Democritus, Galen (?), Clement of Alexandria,
               Lactantius, St. Isidore of Seville, Bartholomeus Anglicus, St.
               Albert the Great, St. Thomas of Aquinas, Peter of Crescentius
               (?), Paracelsus, Jerome Cardan, Levinus Lemnius, Venette, John
               Ray, Buffon, Bonnet, Maupertius, von Haller and Herbert Spencer.

  abstract  = "A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the
               euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the
               whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA
               sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853
               high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome)
               from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five
               individuals. Two assembly strategies-a whole-genome assembly and
               a regional chromosome assembly-were used, each combining
               sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort.
               The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a
               2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been
               sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and
               assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This
               brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold,
               reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over
               what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly
               strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with
               independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the
               euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90\% of
               the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and
               25\% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger.
               Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding
               transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence
               and an additional approximately 12,000 computationally derived
               genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence.
               Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes
               are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of
               apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1\% of the genome is
               spanned by exons, whereas 24\% is in introns, with 75\% of the
               genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications of segmental blocks,
               ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant
               throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary history.
               Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of
               genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific
               developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune
               systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence
               and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1
               million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of
               human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on
               average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of
               polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1\% of all SNPs
               resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining
               which SNPs have functional consequences remains an open
               challenge.",

               technique is widely applied, varying error rates have been
               observed. We analysed millions of reads obtained after
               sequencing of one single sequence on an Illumina sequencer.
               According to our analysis, the index-PCR for sample preparation
               has no effect on the observed error rate, even though PCR is
               traditionally seen as one of the major contributors to enhanced
               error rates in NGS. In addition, we observed very persistent
               pre-phasing effects although the base calling software corrects
               for these. Removal of shortened sequences abolished these
               effects and allowed analysis of the actual mutations. The
               average error rate determined was 0.24 $\pm$ 0.06\% per base and
               the percentage of mutated sequences was found to be 6.4 $\pm$

               no effect on mutation rates and re-sequencing of samples obtains

  abstract  = "Transposable elements (TEs) are conventionally identified in
               eukaryotic genomes by alignment to consensus element sequences.
               Using this approach, about half of the human genome has been
               previously identified as TEs and low-complexity repeats. We
               recently developed a highly sensitive alternative de novo
               strategy, P-clouds, that instead searches for clusters of
               high-abundance oligonucleotides that are related in sequence
               space (oligo ``clouds''). We show here that P-clouds predicts
               >840 Mbp of additional repetitive sequences in the human genome,
               thus suggesting that 66\%-69\% of the human genome is repetitive
               or repeat-derived. To investigate this remarkable difference, we
               conducted detailed analyses of the ability of both P-clouds and
               a commonly used conventional approach, RepeatMasker (RM), to
               detect different sized fragments of the highly abundant human
               Alu and MIR SINEs. RM can have surprisingly low sensitivity for
               even moderately long fragments, in contrast to P-clouds, which
               has good sensitivity down to small fragment sizes (∼25 bp).
               Although short fragments have a high intrinsic probability of
               being false positives, we performed a probabilistic annotation
               that reflects this fact. We further developed
               ``element-specific'' P-clouds (ESPs) to identify novel Alu and
               MIR SINE elements, and using it we identified ∼100 Mb of
               previously unannotated human elements. ESP estimates of new MIR
               sequences are in good agreement with RM-based predictions of the
               amount that RM missed. These results highlight the need for
               combined, probabilistic genome annotation approaches and suggest
               that the human genome consists of substantially more repetitive
               sequence than previously believed.",

              embryonic stem cells has enabled the simple generation of mice
              lacking a specific gene. However, it is evident that in a

              be detected. Advancements in the field of mouse phenotyping and
              use of extensive phenotyping tests on each knockout showed that

              assessment of transcriptome and proteome data based on conserved

              Here, we argue that the intended meaning of RPKM is a measure of

              of the number of transcripts mapped. Further, we show that RPKM

              accurate measure of rmc. We propose a slight modification of RPKM
              that eliminates this inconsistency and call it TPM for
              transcripts per million. TPM respects the average invariance and

              expression for thousands of genes at once. Various studies have
              been published comparing competing platforms with mixed results:
              some find agreement, others do not. As the number of researchers
              starting to use microarrays and the number of cross-platform
              meta-analysis studies rapidly increases, appropriate platform
              assessments become more important. Here we present results from a
              comparison study that offers important improvements over those
              previously described in the literature. In particular, we noticed
              that none of the previously published papers consider differences
              between labs. For this study, a consortium of ten laboratories
              from the Washington, DC-Baltimore, USA, area was formed to
              compare data obtained from three widely used platforms using
              identical RNA samples. We used appropriate statistical analysis
              to demonstrate that there are relatively large differences in

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: SCOP and CATH are widely used as gold standards to
              benchmark novel protein structure comparison methods as well as
              to train machine learning approaches for protein structure
              classification and prediction. The two hierarchies result from
              different protocols which may result in differing classifications
              of the same protein. Ignoring such differences leads to problems
              when being used to train or benchmark automatic structure
              classification methods. Here, we propose a method to compare SCOP
              and CATH in detail and discuss possible applications of this
              analysis. RESULTS: We create a new mapping between SCOP and CATH
              and define a consistent benchmark set which is shown to largely
              reduce errors made by structure comparison methods such as
              TM-Align and has useful further applications, e.g. for machine
              learning methods being trained for protein structure
              classification. Additionally, we extract additional connections
              in the topology of the protein fold space from the orthogonal
              features contained in SCOP and CATH. CONCLUSION: Via an
              all-to-all comparison, we find that there are large and
              unexpected differences between SCOP and CATH w.r.t. their domain
              definitions as well as their hierarchic partitioning of the fold
              space on every level of the two classifications. A consistent

              with greater selectively than those that use pairwise
              comparisons. Of the profile methods, hidden Markov models (HMMs)
              are apparently the best. The first part of this paper describes
              calculations that (i) improve the performance of HMMs and (ii)
              determine a good procedure for creating HMMs for sequences of
              proteins of known structure. For a family of related proteins,
              more homologues are detected using multiple models built from
              diverse single seed sequences than from one model built from a
              good alignment of those sequences. A new procedure is described
              for detecting and correcting those errors that arise at the
              model-building stage of the procedure. These two improvements
              greatly increase selectivity and coverage. The second part of the
              paper describes the construction of a library of HMMs, called
              SUPERFAMILY, that represent essentially all proteins of known
              structure. The sequences of the domains in proteins of known
              structure, that have identities less than 95 \%, are used as
              seeds to build the models. Using the current data, this gives a
              library with 4894 models. The third part of the paper describes
              the use of the SUPERFAMILY model library to annotate the
              sequences of over 50 genomes. The models match twice as many
              target sequences as are matched by pairwise sequence comparison
              methods. For each genome, close to half of the sequences are
              matched in all or in part and, overall, the matches cover 35 \%
              of eukaryotic genomes and 45 \% of bacterial genomes. On average
              roughly 15\% of genome sequences are labelled as being
              hypothetical yet homologous to proteins of known structure. The
              annotations derived from these matches are available from a
              public web server at: http://stash.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/SUPERFAMILY.

               Predictor",
  author    = "Fang, Hai and Gough, Julian",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Computational/manual annotations of protein
               functions are one of the first routes to making sense of a newly
               sequenced genome. Protein domain predictions form an essential
               part of this annotation process. This is due to the natural
               modularity of proteins with domains as structural, evolutionary
               and functional units. Sometimes two, three, or more adjacent
               domains (called supra-domains) are the operational unit
               responsible for a function, e.g. via a binding site at the
               interface. These supra-domains have contributed to functional
               diversification in higher organisms. Traditionally functional
               ontologies have been applied to individual proteins, rather than
               families of related domains and supra-domains. We expect,
               however, to some extent functional signals can be carried by
               protein domains and supra-domains, and consequently used in
               function prediction and functional genomics. RESULTS: Here we
               present a domain-centric Gene Ontology (dcGO) perspective. We
               generalize a framework for automatically inferring ontological
               terms associated with domains and supra-domains from full-length
               sequence annotations. This general framework has been applied
               specifically to primary protein-level annotations from
               UniProtKB-GOA, generating GO term associations with SCOP domains
               and supra-domains. The resulting 'dcGO Predictor', can be used
               to provide functional annotation to protein sequences. The
               functional annotation of sequences in the Critical Assessment of
               Function Annotation (CAFA) has been used as a valuable
               opportunity to validate our method and to be assessed by the
               community. The functional annotation of all completely sequenced
               genomes has demonstrated the potential for domain-centric GO
               enrichment analysis to yield functional insights into newly
               sequenced or yet-to-be-annotated genomes. This generalized
               framework we have presented has also been applied to other
               domain classifications such as InterPro and Pfam, and other

              (nsSNPs) are being identified in the human genome is increasing
              dramatically owing to advances in whole-genome/whole-exome
              sequencing technologies. Automated methods capable of accurately
              and reliably distinguishing between pathogenic and functionally
              neutral nsSNPs are therefore assuming ever-increasing importance.
              Here, we describe the Functional Analysis Through Hidden Markov
              Models (FATHMM) software and server: a species-independent method
              with optional species-specific weightings for the prediction of
              the functional effects of protein missense variants. Using a
              model weighted for human mutations, we obtained performance
              accuracies that outperformed traditional prediction methods
              (i.e., SIFT, PolyPhen, and PANTHER) on two separate benchmarks.
              Furthermore, in one benchmark, we achieve performance accuracies
              that outperform current state-of-the-art prediction methods
              (i.e., SNPs\&GO and MutPred). We demonstrate that FATHMM can be
              efficiently applied to high-throughput/large-scale human and
              nonhuman genome sequencing projects with the added benefit of
              phenotypic outcome associations. To illustrate this, we evaluated
              nsSNPs in wheat (Triticum spp.) to identify some of the important
              genetic variants responsible for the phenotypic differences
              introduced by intense selection during domestication. A Web-based

               true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each
               scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less
               likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are
               smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater
               number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where

              commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray

              these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data
              sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power
              to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical
              considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require
              the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is
              inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch
              effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from
              data, but these are often complicated and require large batch
              sizes ( > 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray
              studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing

              It is specifically designed for supporting the computational
              representation of biological systems. A GO annotation is an

              together making a statement pertinent to the function of that
              gene. However, the meaning of the term ``function'' is not as
              straightforward as it might seem, and has been discussed at

              and Yakhini, Zohar",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Since the inception of the GO annotation project, a
              variety of tools have been developed that support exploring and
              searching the GO database. In particular, a variety of tools that
              perform GO enrichment analysis are currently available. Most of
              these tools require as input a target set of genes and a
              background set and seek enrichment in the target set compared to
              the background set. A few tools also exist that support analyzing
              ranked lists. The latter typically rely on simulations or on
              union-bound correction for assigning statistical significance to
              the results. RESULTS: GOrilla is a web-based application that
              identifies enriched GO terms in ranked lists of genes, without
              requiring the user to provide explicit target and background
              sets. This is particularly useful in many typical cases where
              genomic data may be naturally represented as a ranked list of
              genes (e.g. by level of expression or of differential
              expression). GOrilla employs a flexible threshold statistical
              approach to discover GO terms that are significantly enriched at
              the top of a ranked gene list. Building on a complete theoretical
              characterization of the underlying distribution, called mHG,
              GOrilla computes an exact p-value for the observed enrichment,
              taking threshold multiple testing into account without the need
              for simulations. This enables rigorous statistical analysis of
              thousand of genes and thousands of GO terms in order of seconds.
              The output of the enrichment analysis is visualized as a
              hierarchical structure, providing a clear view of the relations
              between enriched GO terms. CONCLUSION: GOrilla is an efficient GO
              analysis tool with unique features that make a useful addition to
              the existing repertoire of GO enrichment tools. GOrilla's unique
              features and advantages over other threshold free enrichment
              tools include rigorous statistics, fast running time and an
              effective graphical representation. GOrilla is publicly available

              demographic, and technical factors may have substantial effects
              on gene expression levels. In addition to the measured
              variable(s) of interest, there will tend to be sources of signal
              due to factors that are unknown, unmeasured, or too complicated
              to capture through simple models. We show that failing to
              incorporate these sources of heterogeneity into an analysis can
              have widespread and detrimental effects on the study. Not only
              can this reduce power or induce unwanted dependence across genes,
              but it can also introduce sources of spurious signal to many
              genes. This phenomenon is true even for well-designed, randomized
              studies. We introduce ``surrogate variable analysis'' (SVA) to
              overcome the problems caused by heterogeneity in expression
              studies. SVA can be applied in conjunction with standard analysis
              techniques to accurately capture the relationship between
              expression and any modeled variables of interest. We apply SVA to
              disease class, time course, and genetics of gene expression

              simulate RNA-seq data, beginning with an experimental design and
              ending with collections of RNA-seq reads. Its main advantage is
              the ability to simulate reads indicating isoform-level

              highly correlated with tissue specificity. However, the impact of

               This analysis helps to understand the cell's strategy to use

               Overall gene expression correlation was high between the 22
               corresponding tissues analyzed (R > 0.8). For genes ubiquitously
               expressed across all tissues, the two data sets showed high
               genome-wide correlation (91\% agreement), with differences
               observed for a small number of individual genes indicating the
               need to update their gene models. Among the identified
               single-tissue enriched genes, up to 75\% showed consensus of
               7-fold enrichment in the same tissue in both methods, while
               another 17\% exhibited multiple tissue enrichment and/or high
               expression variety in the other data set, likely dependent on

              whole body can provide valuable information for a holistic
              understanding of this fundamental process. In this work, we

              However, enrichment for some well-known aging components such as
              mitochondria biology is observed in many tissues. Different

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: A major bottleneck in our understanding of the
              molecular underpinnings of life is the assignment of function to
              proteins. While molecular experiments provide the most reliable
              annotation of proteins, their relatively low throughput and
              restricted purview have led to an increasing role for
              computational function prediction. However, assessing methods for
              protein function prediction and tracking progress in the field
              remain challenging. RESULTS: We conducted the second critical
              assessment of functional annotation (CAFA), a timed challenge to
              assess computational methods that automatically assign protein
              function. We evaluated 126 methods from 56 research groups for
              their ability to predict biological functions using Gene Ontology
              and gene-disease associations using Human Phenotype Ontology on a
              set of 3681 proteins from 18 species. CAFA2 featured expanded
              analysis compared with CAFA1, with regards to data set size,
              variety, and assessment metrics. To review progress in the field,
              the analysis compared the best methods from CAFA1 to those of
              CAFA2. CONCLUSIONS: The top-performing methods in CAFA2
              outperformed those from CAFA1. This increased accuracy can be
              attributed to a combination of the growing number of experimental
              annotations and improved methods for function prediction. The
              assessment also revealed that the definition of top-performing
              algorithms is ontology specific, that different performance
              metrics can be used to probe the nature of accurate predictions,
              and the relative diversity of predictions in the biological
              process and human phenotype ontologies. While there was
              methodological improvement between CAFA1 and CAFA2, the
              interpretation of results and usefulness of individual methods
              remain context-dependent.",

              covariation matrix of high-confidence associations of >1,000

              analyzed the differential expression of a gene or complex
              involved in a particular disease in the tissues affected by the
              disease, compared with nonaffected tissues. When this analysis is

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: In attempts to determine the genetic causes of human
              disease, researchers are often faced with a large number of
              candidate genes. Linkage studies can point to a genomic region
              containing hundreds of genes, while the high-throughput
              sequencing approach will often identify a great number of
              non-synonymous genetic variants. Since systematic experimental
              verification of each such candidate gene is not feasible, a
              method is needed to decide which genes are worth investigating
              further. Computational gene prioritization presents itself as a
              solution to this problem, systematically analyzing and sorting
              each gene from the most to least likely to be the disease-causing
              gene, in a fraction of the time it would take a researcher to
              perform such queries manually. RESULTS: Here, we present Gene
              TIssue Expression Ranker (GeneTIER), a new web-based application
              for candidate gene prioritization. GeneTIER replaces
              knowledge-based inference traditionally used in candidate disease
              gene prioritization applications with experimental data from
              tissue-specific gene expression datasets and thus largely
              overcomes the bias toward the better characterized genes/diseases
              that commonly afflict other methods. We show that our approach is
              capable of accurate candidate gene prioritization and illustrate
              its strengths and weaknesses using case study examples.

              compare the genetic variation between two groups to single out
              certain Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that are linked to
              a phenotypic variation in one of the groups. However, it is
              necessary to have a large enough sample size to find
              statistically significant correlations. Direct-To-Consumer (DTC)
              genetic testing can supply additional data: DTC-companies offer
              the analysis of a large amount of SNPs for an individual at low
              cost without the need to consult a physician or geneticist. Over

              Direct-To-Consumer genetic testing companies. However, this data

              vocabularies, such as Gene Ontology (GO)
              (http://www.geneontology.org), address the need for consistent
              descriptions of genes in different data sources, there is still
              no effective method to determine the functional similarities of
              genes based on gene annotation information from heterogeneous
              data sources. RESULTS: To address this critical need, we proposed
              a novel method to encode a GO term's semantics (biological
              meanings) into a numeric value by aggregating the semantic
              contributions of their ancestor terms (including this specific
              term) in the GO graph and, in turn, designed an algorithm to
              measure the semantic similarity of GO terms. Based on the
              semantic similarities of GO terms used for gene annotation, we
              designed a new algorithm to measure the functional similarity of
              genes. The results of using our algorithm to measure the
              functional similarities of genes in pathways retrieved from the
              saccharomyces genome database (SGD), and the outcomes of
              clustering these genes based on the similarity values obtained by
              our algorithm are shown to be consistent with human perspectives.

              tests, particularly in non-coding regions where the majority of
              pathogenic mutations are likely to be found. Availability and
              implementation: The FATHMM-XF web server is available at
              http://fathmm.biocompute.org.uk/fathmm-xf/, and as tracks on the

              resource to help to understand the genetic contribution to
              disease. Here we describe the genomes of 1,092 individuals from
              14 populations, constructed using a combination of low-coverage
              whole-genome and exome sequencing. By developing methods to
              integrate information across several algorithms and diverse data
              sources, we provide a validated haplotype map of 38 million
              single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1.4 million short insertions and
              deletions, and more than 14,000 larger deletions. We show that
              individuals from different populations carry different profiles
              of rare and common variants, and that low-frequency variants show
              substantial geographic differentiation, which is further
              increased by the action of purifying selection. We show that
              evolutionary conservation and coding consequence are key
              determinants of the strength of purifying selection, that
              rare-variant load varies substantially across biological
              pathways, and that each individual contains hundreds of rare
              non-coding variants at conserved sites, such as motif-disrupting
              changes in transcription-factor-binding sites. This resource,
              which captures up to 98\% of accessible single nucleotide
              polymorphisms at a frequency of 1\% in related populations,

               (i) maintains access to 1000 Genomes Project resources, (ii)
               updates 1000 Genomes Project resources to the GRCh38 human
               reference assembly, (iii) adds new data generated on 1000

               least in conjunction with one another) in the IQ literature. It
               suggests that all of the population variance in IQ scores can be
               described in terms of a nexus of sociocognitive-affective
               factors that differentially prepares individuals for the
               cognitive, affective and performance demands of the test?in
               effect that the test is a measure of social class background,
               and not one of the ability for complex cognition as such. The
               rest of the paper shows how such factors can explain the
               correlational evidence usually thought to validate IQ tests,
               including associations with educational attainments,
               occupational performance and elementary cognitive tasks, as well
               as the intercorrelations among tests themselves.",

               construction is the question of what, precisely, is being
               constructed. Facts, gender, quarks, reality? Is it a person? An
               object? An idea? A theory? Each entails a different notion of
               social construction, Ian Hacking reminds us. His book explores
               an array of examples to reveal the deep issues underlying
               contentious accounts of reality.Especially troublesome in this
               dispute is the status of the natural sciences, and this is where
               Hacking finds some of his most telling cases, from the conflict
               between biological and social approaches to mental illness to
               vying accounts of current research in sedimentary geology. He
               looks at the issue of child abuse--very much a reality, though
               the idea of child abuse is a social product. He also cautiously
               examines the ways in which advanced research on new weapons
               influences not the content but the form of science. In
               conclusion, Hacking comments on the ``culture wars'' in
               anthropology, in particular a spat between leading ethnographers
               over Hawaii and Captain Cook. Written with generosity and gentle
               wit by one of our most distinguished philosophers of science,

              response bias, and particularly dissimulating a socially
              desirable response to self-report data. Various terminological
              differences are discussed as well as the way test constructors
              attempt to measure or overcome social desirability response sets.
              As an example of the research in this field, four types of
              studies measuring social desirability in the Eysenckian
              personality measures (MPI, EPI, EPQ) are reviewed. Also studies
              of faking in psychiatric symptom inventories, and a wide range of
              other tests are briefly reviewed. Various equivocal results from
              attempts to determine what makes some measures more prone to
              social desirability than others. However there appears to be
              growing evidence that social desirability is a relatively stable,

              studies of`abnormal groups' perception of normality are examined.

              bias in standardized diagnostic interviews?",
  author   = "Kn{\"a}uper, B and Wittchen, H U",
  abstract = "Recent epidemiological and family genetic studies in different
              countries using standardized diagnostic interviews for mental
              disorders have rather consistently demonstrated considerably
              lower current (e.g. ECA Study: 0.9\%) and lifetime (1.4\%)
              prevalence estimates of Major Depression in the elderly (older
              than 65 years of age) as compared to younger age groups (e.g.
              30-44 years: 1 year, 3.9\%; lifetime, 7.5\%). Some investigators
              have questioned the validity of these data and suggested
              alternative interpretations. One possibility is that the complex
              standardized symptoms and clinical probe questions, and the
              required judgmental process inherent in diagnostic interviews
              exceed the cognitive capacity of older adults. This may result in
              systematic response bias. This paper examines the degree to which
              the lower prevalence estimates of depression in the elderly are
              biased due to specific characteristics of the assessment
              strategy. Analyses of epidemiologic data from the Munich
              Follow-up Study (MFS), based on the Diagnostic Interview
              Schedule, demonstrate that (1) older respondents report lifetime
              depressive symptoms with the same frequency as younger
              respondents. The additional probe questions designed to identify
              the degree to which symptoms were caused by factors other than
              psychological revealed that (2) the elderly more often attribute
              such symptoms to physical illnesses or conditions. This results
              in (3) the exclusion of the reported symptoms as a basis for
              diagnosing depression. A laboratory study demonstrated that
              ``working memory capacity'' was a good predictor of this response
              behavior, indicating that the complexity of the formalized
              questions exceeds the cognitive capacity of the elderly.
              Attributing symptoms to a physical illness or condition might be
              a heuristic strategy to simplify complex recall and judgment
              processes; the resulting answer is plausible but incorrect. We
              recommend that the symptom and probe questions of standardized
              diagnostic interviews be simplified, especially for use with the
              elderly.",

              every aspect of RNA biology is influenced by its folding. This is
              a particularly important consideration in the era of
              high-throughput sequencing, when the discovery of novel

              molecules per cell for signaling proteins, to millions of

              through a literature search of Pubmed.gov followed by a
              standardised assessment of acronym quality (BEAUTY and CHEATING
              criteria). PARTICIPANTS: Randomised controlled trials within
              psychiatry, rheumatology, pulmonary medicine, endocrinology, and
              cardiology published between 2000 and 2012. MAIN OUTCOME
              MEASURES: Prevalence proportion of acronyms and composite quality
              score for acronyms over time. RESULTS: 14,965 publications were
              identified, of which 18.3\% (n=2737) contained an acronym in the
              title. Acronym use was more common among cardiological studies
              than among the other four medical specialties (40\% v 8-15\% in
              2012, P<0.001). Except for within cardiology, the prevalence of
              acronyms increased over time, with the average prevalence
              proportion among the remaining four specialties increasing from
              4.0\% to 12.4\% from 2000 to 2012 (P<0.001). The median combined
              acronym quality score decreased significantly over the study
              period (P<0.001), from a median 9.25 in 2000 to 5.50 in 2012.
              CONCLUSION: From 2000 to 2012 the prevalence of acronyms in trial
              reports increased, coinciding with a substantial decrease in the
              technical and aesthetic quality of the acronyms. Strict
              enforcement of current guidelines on acronym construction by

               protein domain annotations, particularly those in the dcGO
               database. The dcGO is a comprehensive resource for protein
               domain annotations using a panel of ontologies including Gene
               Ontology. Although increasing in popularity, this database needs
               statistical and graphical support to meet its full potential.
               Moreover, there are no bioinformatics tools specifically
               designed for domain ontology analysis. As an add-on package
               built in the R software environment, dcGOR offers a basic
               infrastructure with great flexibility and functionality. It
               implements new data structure to represent domains, ontologies,
               annotations, and all analytical outputs as well. For each
               ontology, it provides various mining facilities, including: (i)
               domain-based enrichment analysis and visualisation; (ii)
               construction of a domain (semantic similarity) network according
               to ontology annotations; and (iii) significance analysis for
               estimating a contact (statistical significance) network. To
               reduce runtime, most analyses support high-performance parallel
               computing. Taking as inputs a list of protein domains of
               interest, the package is able to easily carry out in-depth
               analyses in terms of functional, phenotypic and diseased
               relevance, and network-level understanding. More importantly,
               dcGOR is designed to allow users to import and analyse their own
               ontologies and annotations on domains (taken from SCOP, Pfam and
               InterPro) and RNAs (from Rfam) as well. The package is freely

              volume after 3 weeks. DNA ploidy was evaluated by flow cytometry.
              Invasive ability of the lines was tested with the MATRIGEL
              invasion assay at 24 or 48 hours. Cells were assessed for the
              presence of Kirsten-Ras (K-Ras), p-53, deleted in colon cancer
              (DCC), and Src. Protein profiling of cells and tissue was
              performed by surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of
              flight/mass spectroscopy. microRNA expression in cell and tumor
              tissue samples was evaluated by FlexmiR MicroRNA Assays. Four
              cell lines were generated from tumor tissue from patients with
              CRC and confirmed to be tumorigenic (mean tumor volume 158.46
              mm(3)). Two cell lines were noted to be diploid; two were
              aneuploid. All cell lines invaded the MATRIGEL starting as early
              as 24 hours. K-Ras, p53, DCC, and Src expression were markedly
              different between cell lines and corresponding tissue. Protein
              profiling yielded weak-to-moderate correlations between cell
              samples and respective tissues of origin. Weak-to-moderate tau
              correlations for levels of expression of human microRNAs were
              found between cells and respective tissue samples for each of the
              four pairings. Although our primary CRC cell lines vary in their
              expression of several tumor markers and known microRNAs from
              their respective progenitor tumor tissue, they do not
              statistically differ in overall profiles. Characteristics are
              retained that deem these cell lines appropriate models of
              disease; however, data acquired through the use of cell culture

  abstract = "Cell lines are often used in place of primary cells to study
              biological processes. However, care must be taken when
              interpreting the results as cell lines do not always accurately
              replicate the primary cells. In this article, we will briefly
              talk about advantages and disadvantages of cell lines and then
              discuss results using the mouse Sertoli cell line, MSC-1,
              compared with primary mouse Sertoli cells. MSC-1 cells resemble
              Sertoli cells morphologically and possess several biochemical
              markers associated with Sertoli cells. Studies have demonstrated
              that the function and regulation of retinoic acid receptor
              $\alpha$ (RAR$\alpha$) is similar between MSC-1 and rat Sertoli
              cells. However, MSC-1 cells lack some of the immune privilege
              properties associated with primary Sertoli cells, including
              survival in animals with a fully functional immune system.
              Therefore, it has to be kept in mind that cell lines do not
              behave identically with primary cells and should not be used to
              replace primary cells. In order to strengthen the findings, key

  author   = "Fairbanks, Daniel J",
  abstract = "Mendel and Darwin were contemporaries, with much overlap in their
              scientifically productive years. Available evidence shows that
              Mendel knew much about Darwin, whereas Darwin knew nothing of
              Mendel. Because of the fragmentary nature of this evidence,
              published inferences regarding Mendel's views on Darwinian
              evolution are contradictory and enigmatic, with claims ranging
              from enthusiastic acceptance to outright rejection. The objective
              of this review is to examine evidence from Mendel's published and
              private writings on evolution and Darwin, and the influence of
              the scientific environment in which he was immersed. Much of this
              evidence lies in Mendel's handwritten annotations in his copies
              of Darwin's books, which this review scrutinises in detail.
              Darwin's writings directly influenced Mendel's classic 1866
              paper, and his letters to N{\"a}geli. He commended and criticised
              Darwin on specific issues pertinent to his research, including
              the provisional hypothesis of pangenesis, the role of pollen in
              fertilisation, and the influence of ``conditions of life'' on
              heritable variation. In his final letter to N{\"a}geli, Mendel
              proposed a Darwinian scenario for natural selection using the
              same German term for ``struggle for existence'' as in his copies
              of Darwin's books. His published and private scientific writings
              are entirely objective, devoid of polemics or religious
              allusions, and address evolutionary questions in a manner
              consistent with that of his scientific contemporaries. The image
              that emerges of Mendel is of a meticulous scientist who accepted
              the tenets of Darwinian evolution, while privately pinpointing
              aspects of Darwin's views of inheritance that were not supported
              by Mendel's own experiments.",

              strongly affects the abundance of expressed proteins in
              Escherichia coli. However, detailed secondary structural features
              governing protein abundance remain elusive. Recent advances in
              high-throughput DNA synthesis and experimental systems enable us
              to obtain large amounts of data. Here, we evaluated six types of
              structural features using two large-scale datasets. We found that
              accessibility, which is the probability that a given region
              around the start codon has no base-paired nucleotides, showed the
              highest correlation with protein abundance in both datasets.
              Accessibility showed a significantly higher correlation
              (Spearman's $\rho$ = 0.709) than the widely used minimum free
              energy (0.554) in one of the datasets. Interestingly,
              accessibility showed the highest correlation only when it was
              calculated by a log-linear model, indicating that the RNA
              structural model and how to utilize it are important.
              Furthermore, by combining the accessibility and activity of the
              Shine-Dalgarno sequence, we devised a method for predicting
              protein abundance more accurately than existing methods. We
              inferred that the log-linear model has a broader probabilistic
              distribution than the widely used Turner energy model, which

              While many tools exist for the edition, alignment or evaluation

              programming interface, i.e. for accessing and modifying an
              ontology within a programming language. Existing query languages
              (such as SPARQL) and APIs (such as OWLAPI) are not as easy-to-use
              as object programming languages are. Moreover, they provide few
              solutions to difficulties encountered with biomedical ontologies.
              Our objective was to design a tool for accessing easily the
              entities of an OWL ontology, with high-level constructs helping
              with biomedical ontologies. METHODS: From our experience on
              medical ontologies, we identified two difficulties: (1) many
              entities are represented by classes (rather than individuals),
              but the existing tools do not permit manipulating classes as
              easily as individuals, (2) ontologies rely on the open-world
              assumption, whereas the medical reasoning must consider only
              evidence-based medical knowledge as true. We designed a Python
              module for ontology-oriented programming. It allows access to the
              entities of an OWL ontology as if they were objects in the
              programming language. We propose a simple high-level syntax for
              managing classes and the associated ``role-filler'' constraints.
              We also propose an algorithm for performing local closed world
              reasoning in simple situations. RESULTS: We developed Owlready, a
              Python module for a high-level access to OWL ontologies. The
              paper describes the architecture and the syntax of the module
              version 2. It details how we integrated the OWL ontology model
              with the Python object model. The paper provides examples based
              on Gene Ontology (GO). We also demonstrate the interest of
              Owlready in a use case focused on the automatic comparison of the
              contraindications of several drugs. This use case illustrates the
              use of the specific syntax proposed for manipulating classes and
              for performing local closed world reasoning. CONCLUSION: Owlready
              has been successfully used in a medical research project. It has
              been published as Open-Source software and then used by many
              other researchers. Future developments will focus on the support
              of vagueness and additional non-monotonic reasoning feature, and
              automatic dialog box generation.",

  abstract = "Recent studies indicate that the initial classification of
              transposable elements (TEs) as 'useless', 'selfish' or 'junk'
              pieces of DNA is not an accurate one. TEs seem to have complex
              regulatory functions and contribute to the coding regions of many
              genes. Because this contribution had been documented only at
              transcript level, we searched for evidence that would also
              support the translation of TE cassettes. Our findings suggest
              that the proportion of proteins with TE-encoded fragments
              (approximately 0.1\%), although probably underestimated, is much
              less than what the data at transcript level suggest
              (approximately 4\%). In all cases, the TE cassettes are derived
              from old TEs, consistent with the idea that incorporation
              (exaptation) of TE fragments into functional proteins requires
              long evolutionary periods. We therefore argue that functional
              proteins are unlikely to contain TE cassettes derived from young
              TEs, the role of which is probably limited to regulatory
              functions.",

  abstract = "The frequency with which scientists fabricate and falsify data,
              or commit other forms of scientific misconduct is a matter of
              controversy. Many surveys have asked scientists directly whether
              they have committed or know of a colleague who committed research
              misconduct, but their results appeared difficult to compare and
              synthesize. This is the first meta-analysis of these surveys. To
              standardize outcomes, the number of respondents who recalled at
              least one incident of misconduct was calculated for each
              question, and the analysis was limited to behaviours that distort
              scientific knowledge: fabrication, falsification, ``cooking'' of
              data, etc... Survey questions on plagiarism and other forms of
              professional misconduct were excluded. The final sample consisted
              of 21 surveys that were included in the systematic review, and 18
              in the meta-analysis. A pooled weighted average of 1.97\% (N = 7,
              95\%CI: 0.86-4.45) of scientists admitted to have fabricated,
              falsified or modified data or results at least once--a serious
              form of misconduct by any standard--and up to 33.7\% admitted
              other questionable research practices. In surveys asking about
              the behaviour of colleagues, admission rates were 14.12\% (N =
              12, 95\% CI: 9.91-19.72) for falsification, and up to 72\% for
              other questionable research practices. Meta-regression showed
              that self reports surveys, surveys using the words
              ``falsification'' or ``fabrication'', and mailed surveys yielded
              lower percentages of misconduct. When these factors were
              controlled for, misconduct was reported more frequently by
              medical/pharmacological researchers than others. Considering that
              these surveys ask sensitive questions and have other limitations,
              it appears likely that this is a conservative estimate of the
              true prevalence of scientific misconduct.",

  abstract = "Data analysis workflows in many scientific domains have become
              increasingly complex and flexible. Here we assess the effect of
              this flexibility on the results of functional magnetic resonance
              imaging by asking 70 independent teams to analyse the same
              dataset, testing the same 9 ex-ante hypotheses1. The flexibility
              of analytical approaches is exemplified by the fact that no two
              teams chose identical workflows to analyse the data. This
              flexibility resulted in sizeable variation in the results of
              hypothesis tests, even for teams whose statistical maps were
              highly correlated at intermediate stages of the analysis
              pipeline. Variation in reported results was related to several
              aspects of analysis methodology. Notably, a meta-analytical
              approach that aggregated information across teams yielded a
              significant consensus in activated regions. Furthermore,
              prediction markets of researchers in the field revealed an
              overestimation of the likelihood of significant findings, even by
              researchers with direct knowledge of the dataset2-5. Our findings
              show that analytical flexibility can have substantial effects on
              scientific conclusions, and identify factors that may be related
              to variability in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance
              imaging. The results emphasize the importance of validating and
              sharing complex analysis workflows, and demonstrate the need for
              performing and reporting multiple analyses of the same data.
              Potential approaches that could be used to mitigate issues
              related to analytical variability are discussed.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The availability of multiple, essentially complete
              genome sequences of prokaryotes and eukaryotes spurred both the
              demand and the opportunity for the construction of an
              evolutionary classification of genes from these genomes. Such a
              classification system based on orthologous relationships between
              genes appears to be a natural framework for comparative genomics
              and should facilitate both functional annotation of genomes and
              large-scale evolutionary studies. RESULTS: We describe here a
              major update of the previously developed system for delineation
              of Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs) from the
              sequenced genomes of prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes and
              the construction of clusters of predicted orthologs for 7
              eukaryotic genomes, which we named KOGs after eukaryotic
              orthologous groups. The COG collection currently consists of
              138,458 proteins, which form 4873 COGs and comprise 75\% of the
              185,505 (predicted) proteins encoded in 66 genomes of unicellular
              organisms. The eukaryotic orthologous groups (KOGs) include
              proteins from 7 eukaryotic genomes: three animals (the nematode
              Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and
              Homo sapiens), one plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, two fungi
              (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe), and the
              intracellular microsporidian parasite Encephalitozoon cuniculi.
              The current KOG set consists of 4852 clusters of orthologs, which
              include 59,838 proteins, or approximately 54\% of the analyzed
              eukaryotic 110,655 gene products. Compared to the coverage of the
              prokaryotic genomes with COGs, a considerably smaller fraction of
              eukaryotic genes could be included into the KOGs; addition of new
              eukaryotic genomes is expected to result in substantial increase
              in the coverage of eukaryotic genomes with KOGs. Examination of
              the phyletic patterns of KOGs reveals a conserved core
              represented in all analyzed species and consisting of
              approximately 20\% of the KOG set. This conserved portion of the
              KOG set is much greater than the ubiquitous portion of the COG
              set (approximately 1\% of the COGs). In part, this difference is
              probably due to the small number of included eukaryotic genomes,
              but it could also reflect the relative compactness of eukaryotes
              as a clade and the greater evolutionary stability of eukaryotic
              genomes. CONCLUSION: The updated collection of orthologous
              protein sets for prokaryotes and eukaryotes is expected to be a
              useful platform for functional annotation of newly sequenced
              genomes, including those of complex eukaryotes, and genome-wide
              evolutionary studies.",

              diverse eukaryotes enables in-depth comparative-genomic analysis
              which is expected to help in reconstructing ancestral eukaryotic
              genomes and major events in eukaryotic evolution and in making
              functional predictions for currently uncharacterized conserved
              genes. RESULTS: We examined functional and evolutionary patterns
              in the recently constructed set of 5,873 clusters of predicted
              orthologs (eukaryotic orthologous groups or KOGs) from seven
              eukaryotic genomes: Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila
              melanogaster, Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces
              cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Encephalitozoon
              cuniculi. Conservation of KOGs through the phyletic range of
              eukaryotes strongly correlates with their functions and with the
              effect of gene knockout on the organism's viability. The
              approximately 40\% of KOGs that are represented in six or seven
              species are enriched in proteins responsible for housekeeping
              functions, particularly translation and RNA processing. These
              conserved KOGs are often essential for survival and might
              approximate the minimal set of essential eukaryotic genes. The
              131 single-member, pan-eukaryotic KOGs we identified were
              examined in detail. For around 20 that remained uncharacterized,
              functions were predicted by in-depth sequence analysis and
              examination of genomic context. Nearly all these proteins are
              subunits of known or predicted multiprotein complexes, in
              agreement with the balance hypothesis of evolution of gene copy
              number. Other KOGs show a variety of phyletic patterns, which
              points to major contributions of lineage-specific gene loss and
              the 'invention' of genes new to eukaryotic evolution. Examination
              of the sets of KOGs lost in individual lineages reveals
              co-elimination of functionally connected genes. Parsimonious
              scenarios of eukaryotic genome evolution and gene sets for
              ancestral eukaryotic forms were reconstructed. The gene set of
              the last common ancestor of the crown group consists of 3,413
              KOGs and largely includes proteins involved in genome replication
              and expression, and central metabolism. Only 44\% of the KOGs,
              mostly from the reconstructed gene set of the last common
              ancestor of the crown group, have detectable homologs in
              prokaryotes; the remainder apparently evolved via duplication
              with divergence and invention of new genes. CONCLUSIONS: The KOG
              analysis reveals a conserved core of largely essential eukaryotic
              genes as well as major diversification and innovation associated
              with evolution of eukaryotic genomes. The results provide
              quantitative support for major trends of eukaryotic evolution
              noticed previously at the qualitative level and a basis for
              detailed reconstruction of evolution of eukaryotic genomes and

              candidate diseases that best explain a set of clinical features.
              This process can be complicated by the fact that the features can
              have varying degrees of specificity, as well as by the presence
              of features unrelated to the disease itself. Depending on the
              experience of the physician and the availability of laboratory
              tests, clinical abnormalities may be described in greater or
              lesser detail. We have adapted semantic similarity metrics to
              measure phenotypic similarity between queries and hereditary
              diseases annotated with the use of the Human Phenotype Ontology
              (HPO) and have developed a statistical model to assign p values
              to the resulting similarity scores, which can be used to rank the
              candidate diseases. We show that our approach outperforms simpler
              term-matching approaches that do not take the semantic
              interrelationships between terms into account. The advantage of
              our approach was greater for queries containing phenotypic noise
              or imprecise clinical descriptions. The semantic network defined
              by the HPO can be used to refine the differential diagnosis by
              suggesting clinical features that, if present, best differentiate
              among the candidate diagnoses. Thus, semantic similarity searches
              in ontologies represent a useful way of harnessing the semantic
              structure of human phenotypic abnormalities to help with the

               removing low quality and common variants and those deemed

               makes identification of the causative mutation problematic when

  abstract = "Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) holds great potential as a
              diagnostic test. However, the majority of patients currently
              undergoing WGS lack a molecular diagnosis, largely due to the
              vast number of undiscovered disease genes and our inability to
              assess the pathogenicity of most genomic variants. The CAGI
              SickKids challenges attempted to address this knowledge gap by
              assessing state-of-the-art methods for clinical phenotype
              prediction from genomes. CAGI4 and CAGI5 participants were
              provided with WGS data and clinical descriptions of 25 and 24
              undiagnosed patients from the SickKids Genome Clinic Project,
              respectively. Predictors were asked to identify primary and
              secondary causal variants. In addition, for CAGI5, groups had to
              match each genome to one of three disorder categories
              (neurologic, ophthalmologic, and connective), and separately to
              each patient. The performance of matching genomes to categories
              was no better than random but two groups performed significantly
              better than chance in matching genomes to patients. Two of the
              ten variants proposed by two groups in CAGI4 were deemed to be
              diagnostic, and several proposed pathogenic variants in CAGI5 are
              good candidates for phenotype expansion. We discuss implications
              for improving in silico assessment of genomic variants and
              identifying new disease genes.",

              screen to characterise genetic influences on problematic peer
              behaviour during childhood and adolescence. This included a
              series of longitudinal measures (parent-reported
              Strengths-and-Difficulties Questionnaire) from a UK
              population-based birth-cohort (ALSPAC, 4-17 years), and a UK twin
              sample (TEDS, 4-11 years). Longitudinal twin analysis (TEDS; N
              $\leq$ 7,366 twin pairs) showed that peer problems in childhood
              are heritable (4-11 years, 0.60 < twin-h(2) $\leq$ 0.71) but
              genetically heterogeneous from age to age (4-11 years, twin-r(g)
              = 0.30). GCTA (ALSPAC: N $\leq$ 5,608, TEDS: N $\leq$ 2,691)
              provided furthermore little support for the contribution of
              measured common genetic variants during childhood (4-12 years,
              0.02 < GCTA-h(2)(Meta) $\leq$ 0.11) though these influences
              become stronger in adolescence (13-17 years, 0.14 < GCTA-h
              (2)(ALSPAC) $\leq$ 0.27). A subsequent cross-sectional
              genome-wide screen in ALSPAC (N $\leq$ 6,000) focussed on peer
              problems with the highest GCTA-heritability (10, 13 and 17 years,
              0.0002 < GCTA-P $\leq$ 0.03). Single variant signals (P $\leq$
              10(-5)) were followed up in TEDS (N $\leq$ 2835, 9 and 11 years)
              and, in search for autism quantitative trait loci, explored
              within two autism samples (AGRE: N Pedigrees = 793; ACC: N Cases
              = 1,453/N Controls = 7,070). There was, however, no evidence for
              association in TEDS and little evidence for an overlap with the
              autistic continuum. In summary, our findings suggest that

              common measurable genetic variation during adolescence.",

              Analysis (PCA), and recent results in theoretical computer
              science, we present a novel algorithm that, applied on genomewide
              data, selects small subsets of SNPs (PCA-correlated SNPs) to
              reproduce the structure found by PCA on the complete dataset,
              without use of ancestry information. Evaluating our method on a
              previously described dataset (10,805 SNPs, 11 populations), we
              demonstrate that a very small set of PCA-correlated SNPs can be
              effectively employed to assign individuals to particular
              continents or populations, using a simple clustering algorithm.
              We validate our methods on the HapMap populations and achieve
              perfect intercontinental differentiation with 14 PCA-correlated
              SNPs. The Chinese and Japanese populations can be easily
              differentiated using less than 100 PCA-correlated SNPs
              ascertained after evaluating 1.7 million SNPs from HapMap. We
              show that, in general, structure informative SNPs are not
              portable across geographic regions. However, we manage to
              identify a general set of 50 PCA-correlated SNPs that effectively
              assigns individuals to one of nine different populations.
              Compared to analysis with the measure of informativeness, our
              methods, although unsupervised, achieved similar results. We
              proceed to demonstrate that our algorithm can be effectively used
              for the analysis of admixed populations without having to trace
              the origin of individuals. Analyzing a Puerto Rican dataset (192
              individuals, 7,257 SNPs), we show that PCA-correlated SNPs can be
              used to successfully predict structure and ancestry proportions.
              We subsequently validate these SNPs for structure identification
              in an independent Puerto Rican dataset. The algorithm that we
              introduce runs in seconds and can be easily applied on large

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have demonstrated associations
              between genetic markers and COPD, but results have been
              inconsistent. One reason may be heterogeneity in disease
              definition. Unsupervised learning approaches may assist in
              understanding disease heterogeneity. METHODS: We selected 31
              phenotypic variables and 12 SNPs from five candidate genes in 308
              subjects in the National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT)
              Genetics Ancillary Study cohort. We used factor analysis to
              select a subset of phenotypic variables, and then used cluster
              analysis to identify subtypes of severe emphysema. We examined
              the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of each cluster.
              RESULTS: We identified six factors accounting for 75\% of the
              shared variability among our initial phenotypic variables. We
              selected four phenotypic variables from these factors for cluster
              analysis: 1) post-bronchodilator FEV1 percent predicted, 2)
              percent bronchodilator responsiveness, and quantitative CT
              measurements of 3) apical emphysema and 4) airway wall thickness.
              K-means cluster analysis revealed four clusters, though
              separation between clusters was modest: 1) emphysema predominant,
              2) bronchodilator responsive, with higher FEV1; 3) discordant,
              with a lower FEV1 despite less severe emphysema and lower airway
              wall thickness, and 4) airway predominant. Of the genotypes
              examined, membership in cluster 1 (emphysema-predominant) was
              associated with TGFB1 SNP rs1800470. CONCLUSIONS: Cluster
              analysis may identify meaningful disease subtypes and/or groups
              of related phenotypic variables even in a highly selected group

              statistical power is often hindered by batch effects, or unwanted
              variation in data caused by differences in technical factors
              across batches. It is therefore critical to effectively address
              batch effects in genomic data to overcome these challenges. Many
              existing methods for batch effects adjustment assume the data
              follow a continuous, bell-shaped Gaussian distribution. However
              in RNA-seq studies the data are typically skewed, over-dispersed

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Biologists need to perform complex queries, often
              across a variety of databases. Typically, each data resource
              provides an advanced query interface, each of which must be
              learnt by the biologist before they can begin to query them.
              Frequently, more than one data source is required and for
              high-throughput analysis, cutting and pasting results between
              websites is certainly very time consuming. Therefore, many groups
              rely on local bioinformatics support to process queries by
              accessing the resource's programmatic interfaces if they exist.
              This is not an efficient solution in terms of cost and time.
              Instead, it would be better if the biologist only had to learn
              one generic interface. BioMart provides such a solution. RESULTS:
              BioMart enables scientists to perform advanced querying of
              biological data sources through a single web interface. The power
              of the system comes from integrated querying of data sources
              regardless of their geographical locations. Once these queries
              have been defined, they may be automated with its ``scripting at
              the click of a button'' functionality. BioMart's capabilities are
              extended by integration with several widely used software
              packages such as BioConductor, DAS, Galaxy, Cytoscape, Taverna.
              In this paper, we describe all aspects of BioMart from a user's
              perspective and demonstrate how it can be used to solve real
              biological use cases such as SNP selection for candidate gene

              and Bartel, David P",
  abstract = "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous RNAs that pair to sites
              in mRNAs to direct post-transcriptional repression. Many sites
              that match the miRNA seed (nucleotides 2-7), particularly those
              in 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs), are preferentially
              conserved. Here, we overhauled our tool for finding preferential
              conservation of sequence motifs and applied it to the analysis of
              human 3'UTRs, increasing by nearly threefold the detected number
              of preferentially conserved miRNA target sites. The new tool more
              efficiently incorporates new genomes and more completely controls
              for background conservation by accounting for mutational biases,
              dinucleotide conservation rates, and the conservation rates of
              individual UTRs. The improved background model enabled
              preferential conservation of a new site type, the ``offset
              6mer,'' to be detected. In total, >45,000 miRNA target sites
              within human 3'UTRs are conserved above background levels, and
              >60\% of human protein-coding genes have been under selective
              pressure to maintain pairing to miRNAs. Mammalian-specific miRNAs
              have far fewer conserved targets than do the more broadly
              conserved miRNAs, even when considering only more recently
              emerged targets. Although pairing to the 3' end of miRNAs can
              compensate for seed mismatches, this class of sites constitutes
              less than 2\% of all preferentially conserved sites detected. The
              new tool enables statistically powerful analysis of individual
              miRNA target sites, with the probability of preferentially
              conserved targeting (P(CT)) correlating with experimental
              measurements of repression. Our expanded set of target
              predictions (including conserved 3'-compensatory sites), are
              available at the TargetScan website, which displays the P(CT) for
              each site and each predicted target.",
