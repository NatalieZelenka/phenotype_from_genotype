# Methodology
## Snowflake preprocessing
**Missing SNPs and ambiguous flips**
[//]: # (TODO: write - or possibly move to results section)

**Distribution of SNPs per phenotype**
[//]: # (TODO: Distribution of number of SNPs per phenotype for ALSPAC, showing overall and highlighting phenotypes with ground truth information)

**Distribution of SNP scores within phenotypes**
[//]: # (TODO:Â Distribution of number SNP scores within phenotypes - violin plot with some examples - for ALSPAC. Known phenotypes included, dotted lines showing max scores for any SNP.)

Table showing phenotypes with over {glue:text}`large-num-snps` SNPs.
```

[//]: # (TODO: Make sure fig-hist-terms is ok)
[//]: # (TODO: Make sure that I include CTD chemical MESH ids in input in Snowflake section)

Looking at {numref}`fig-hist-terms`, we can see that the majority of terms (>{glue:text}`percent-less-than-100`%) have less than 100 SNPs associated with them, however there are also some with large numbers, for which clustering would be unreliable.
There are {glue:text}`num-phen-many-snps` phenotype terms that have over {glue:text}`large-num-snps` associated SNPs that Snowflake can predict on. 
In {numref}`tbl:over-many-terms`, we can see that these terms are either Comparitive Toxicogenomics Database chemicals, or extremely general disease terms such as *disease of anatomical entity*.

## Requested phenotypes for validation
[//]: # (TODO: Mapping phenotypes to ALSPAC measurements. Write - was done by hand using the ALSPAC catalogue)

the following phenotypes in the ALSPAC cohort: `MP:0001501` *Abnormal Sleep Pattern* (measured using `FJCI250` *Sleep symptom score*), `MP:0001933` *Abnormal litter size* (measured by `mz010a` *Pregnancy size*), `MESH:D001259` *Ataxia* (measured by `kw2030` *Child ever thought to have a problem with clumsiness/coordination*), and `HP:0001249` *Intelligence/intellectual disability* (measured by `f8ws150` *Child had special needs*).

# chosen_phenotypes = ['MESHD001259', 'MP0001933', 'HP0001249', 'HP0007703', 'MP0001501']
# TODO: rerun to get MP.snps files
chosen_phenotypes = ['MESHD001259','HP0001249', 'HP0007703']
chosen_phenotypes_df = term_descriptions.loc[chosen_phenotypes]
chosen_phenotypes_df['Number of SNPs'] = snps.loc[chosen_phenotypes]
display(chosen_phenotypes_df)
